# Terminal Blogger

a project to write blogs in markdown from a command-line.

There are plenty of ways to blog and maybe there is a project just like this but I'm just making to learn some more skills.

When using this a user can open the terminal, start the program and be prompted to write a post from there in markdown. The markdown will be converted to html and added to the bottom of the document. (Maybe added to the top since it is a blog)

Another way to do it is to just write in a text editor or vim (using markdown) and add the post using the command line arguments.

## Skeleten CSS
By default going to include skeleton css files in a css directory and use that as the styling. I'm not planning to add more but it could be done if wanted.


## Dependencies
1. mistune (convert markdown to html
2. tbd


## To Do
1. add post to blog from file (vi or text editor).
2. setup with github pages so when its committed it uploads there.
3. date of blog post
4. add author to the post
