# Markdown converter and joiner

Convert markdown files to html and join them together 

## Usage
`python generate_site.py [directory]`

## Styling
if `style.css` does not exist in the `css` directory, create it.

Edit the `style.css` file in the `css` directory with any styling you want. Skeleton CSS is included by default. Add your own styling on top of it.

### Skeleten CSS
By default going to include skeleton css files in a css directory and use that as the styling. I'm not planning to add more but it could be done if wanted.

This is a mobile friendly styling so it should fit to any screen.

## Dependencies
1. mistune (converting markdown to html)
2. tbd
